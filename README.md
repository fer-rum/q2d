A Digital Schematic Editor (Draft)

Pronounced as きゅとで. At least for now.

Dependencies
============

*q2d* requires external tools to be able to solve the mapping of functions onto circuit designs:
* [*Quantor*](http://fmv.jku.at/quantor/) release 3.2 
* [*picosat*](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) release 960

Their source code must be put in the main q2d directory or the q2d.pro file must be adjusted to contain the correct paths.
